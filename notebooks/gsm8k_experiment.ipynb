    "\n",
    "## 🤖 **LLM-AutoDiff: Auto-Differentiate Any LLM Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Promptimus Prime**! This notebook reproduces the experiments from the paper *\"LLM-AutoDiff: Auto-Differentiate Any LLM Workflow\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize **Textual Gradient Descent (TGD)** to automatically optimize system prompts for Large Language Models. Instead of manual prompt engineering, we treat the prompt as a set of trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 **The Task: GSM8K (Grade School Math)**\n",
    "*   **Goal:** Solve multi-step mathematical reasoning problems.\n",
    "*   **Student Model:** `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` (Lightweight, efficient).\n",
    "*   **Teacher Model:** `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` (Stronger reasoning capabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ **Architecture (Peer Nodes)**\n",
    "We implement the full **Peer Nodes** architecture described in the paper. Instead of a single text block, the optimizer refines three distinct components simultaneously:\n",
    "1.  **Instruction Node:** The core task definition.\n",
    "2.  **Few-Shot Node:** Dynamic examples to guide reasoning.\n",
    "3.  **Format Node:** Constraints on the output structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **The Loop**\n",
    "1.  **Forward Pass:** Student attempts to solve a math problem.\n",
    "2.  **Evaluation:** We check if the final answer matches the Ground Truth.\n",
    "3.  **Backward Pass:** If incorrect, the Teacher analyzes the error and generates a \"Textual Gradient\".\n",
    "4.  **Update:** The Optimizer refines specific Peer Nodes (e.g., adding a new example) to fix the error."
